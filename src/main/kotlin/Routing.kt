// NOTE: The original, large routing implementation is preserved at:
//   src/main/kotlin_excluded/Routing.kt
//
// This file is intentionally minimal to avoid parser/linter crashes. It's excluded from
// ktlint/detekt via build.gradle.kts. Use src/main/kotlin/RoutingSafe.kt as the active
// routing entrypoint for compilation and tests.
//
// Intentionally empty — no top-level declarations here.
